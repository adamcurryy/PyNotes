### Subsetting Lists
- Python lists are ordered collections of items.
- You access individual elements using their index, starting from 0.
- Negative indexes count from the end of the list.
- Slicing allows you to select multiple elements by specifying a range with a colon.
- The start index is included, but the end index is not.
- You can omit the start or end index to include all elements from the beginning or to the end of the list.
- To access Emma's graduation photo, you can use:
    
    ```
    fam_photos = ["baby", "vacation", "wedding", "emma_grad", "mom_bday", "dad"]
    emma_photo = fam_photos[3]
    ```
    
- If you want to see photos from Emma's graduation to your mom's birthday, you can slice:
    
    ```
    family_events = fam_photos[3:5]
    ```
You learned about subsetting lists in Python, which is essential for accessing and manipulating specific elements within a list. Here are the key points you covered:

- **Indexing**: You accessed elements in a list using their index. For example, `fam[3]` retrieves the fourth element.
- **Negative Indexing**: You used negative indexes to count backward from the end of the list. For example, `fam[-1]` retrieves the last element.
- **Slicing**: You selected multiple elements by specifying a range. For example, `fam[1:4]` retrieves elements from index 1 to 3.

#### Key Examples:

- **Basic Indexing**:
    
    ```
    x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    print(x[1])  # Output: "b"
    print(x[-3])  # Output: "b"
    ```
    
- **Slicing**:
    
    ```
    x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    print(x[1:3])  # Output: ["b", "c"]
    ```
