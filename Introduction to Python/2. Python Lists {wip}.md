### Python Lists
- Python has basic data types like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- Lists are a versatile way to store multiple data points under one variable.
- Lists can contain different data types, including other lists.
- You create lists using square brackets, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Lists are useful for organizing related data, like family members' heights and names.
- Lists within lists (nested lists) allow for more complex data structures.

```
picnic_contributions = [
   ["sandwiches", "John"],
   ["drinks", "Sarah"],
   ["fruits", "Mom"],
   ["games", "Dad"]
 ]
 ```

- **List Creation**: You can create a list using square brackets `[]` and store multiple data types within it.
    
    ```
    my_list = ["my", "list", "is", "nice"]
    ```
    
- **Storing Data**: Instead of using separate variables for each data point, you can store related data in a single list. For example, to store the areas of different rooms in your house:
    
    ```
    areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
    ```
    
- **Mixed Data Types**: Lists can contain a mix of different data types, including strings, floats, and even other lists.
    
    ```
    areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0]
    ```
    
- **Lists of Lists**: You can create lists that contain other lists, which is useful for structuring more complex data.
    
    ```
    house = [["hallway", 11.25], ["kitchen", 18.0], ["living room", 20.0], ["bedroom", 10.75], ["bathroom", 9.50]]
    ```
